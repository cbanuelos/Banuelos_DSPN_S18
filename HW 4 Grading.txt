HW 4 Grading
Cristina Ba√±uelos

1. Correct

2. Correct; I could've included more details while comparing all three methods.

3. Correct; I could've stated it more simply, such as its where p approaches n.

4. Correct; Answer key was left on the HW

5a. Correct

5b. Correct

5c. Correct

5d. Correct

5e. Correct

5f. Correct

5g. Correct

5h. Correct? Answer key only states the ones with similar test error rates, and not overall best.

5i. Complete; Different experimentation done

6a. Correct

6b. Correct

6c. Correct; Very different test set and training set solution

6d. Correct; Different factors used, different value compared

6e. Correct; Different factors used, different value compared

6f. Correct; Different factors used, different value compared

6g. Incomplete; Had a bug with the arguments used not being of the same length. I should have made my parameters like the solution:

train.X = cbind(cylinders, weight, displacement, horsepower)[train, ]
test.X = cbind(cylinders, weight, displacement, horsepower)[test, ]
train.mpg01 = mpg01[train]

Instead of:

train = data.frame(trainingSet$displacement)
test = data.frame(testSet$displacement)
cl = trainingSet$mpg01

Otherwise, correct.
