4. Made the correct conclusion, but did not refer to the Central Limit Theorem. 

I also did not calculate the outcomes of rolling the dice the same way, 
and instead created different distributions. 

I had a random generator of 1 number between the minimum and maximum value possible given the number of dice, 
instead of generating a different value from 1-6 for each of dice given. 

For example, I used runif(10000, min =6 , max = 36), 
instead of adding 6 different numbers generated from one die with runif(10000, min =1 , max = 6).
